# Relation 
After Analysis Whole dataset i got some relation which i discribed below.

1. Calories are highly correlated with total steps, so if a man's number of steps increases, then his calories will also decrease accordingly 
2. Those who run and walk fast spent lots of calories compared to slow-walking people.
3. And when I add the total number of steps of people and divide them by the number of days in a week, I get the highest number of steps on Tuesday .
4. Tuesday is a very active day for people, according to data, because the maximum calories are burned on Tuesday.

# Thank you.
